# 5E-NPC-Generator
Generates compelling NPCs for DM use.

At this time, it only outputs to whatever your default directory is (Often My Documents). At some point I want to add a settings page which will provide options to modify specific settings: 
      1. Default Output Directory
      2. Alignment Thresholds (At this time they're set to 1/3rd apiece)
          2.1 Benefits: One could increase the population's alignment chances based on location. 
            If you live in autocracy are you more likely to be lawful? Etc. 
      3. Race Balancing (Currently loosely modeled off of a reddit post) for location specific options.
